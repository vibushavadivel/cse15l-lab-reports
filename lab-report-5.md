## Original Post 
Hi! I am having trouble with the ListExamples `merge` function. For some reason, when I try to merge two lists, instead of getting a merged list, I am getting a list unorganized with the last element of the first list continuously repeating. 
</br> </br>
I feel like it has something to do in the second half of my merge function where I add the elements after the index of one of the lists is equal to or exceeds the length of the other list's size. If someone could help me debug this, that would be very helpful, thank you!

A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)

Make sure you are have the right list variable name when you add it to your final merged list 

Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.

At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
The file & directory structure needed
lib 

Arraylists file
bash.sh 

The contents of each file before fixing the bug


The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
bash.sh 

A description of what to edit to fix the bug


You should actually set up and run the scenario from your screenshots. It should involve at least a Java file and a bash script. Describing the bug should involve reading some output at the terminal resulting from running one or more commands. Design an error that produces more interesting output than a single message about a syntax or unbound identifier error â€“ showcase some interesting wrong behavior! Feel free to set this up by cloning and breaking some existing code like the grading script or code from class, or by designing something of your own from scratch, etc.
